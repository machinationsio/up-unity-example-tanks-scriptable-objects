# Machinations UP

Machinations is the revolutionary visual language for a fast-paced game design process. From prototype to live game updates.

**Machinations UP** (short for Unity Plugin) is how you can bring your designs from **[Machinations](https://www.machinations.io)** into your Unity production.

Check the video here on the Asset Store for a quick overview of what you can currently achieve with our integration.

Or head over to our documentation and go through the [Quick Start](https://docs.machinations.io/machinations-up/quick-start) tutorial.

This asset is both a plugin for the Unity Editor and a framework.

The plugin will add the *Machinations.io Control Panel* into the *Tools* menu in Unity. This will serve as the link between your game and Machinations. Enter your (freely available) API Key from your Machinations Account to connect to diagrams of your choosing.

The *Control Panel* is also where, in the future, we will concentrate juicy functionality such as automagically generating working code based on your diagrams.

The framework part consists of source code files that make up a value mapping & synchronization engine. It is the gateway to the Machinations API and simplifies the process of interacting with your diagrams. The framework is Open Source. Check [UP on GitHub](https://github.com/machinationsio/up-unity3d).

For now, the plugin can only work with one diagram at a time, per project. You can switch between diagrams at any time. This limitation will be removed in the next release.

We are actively developing our plugin and many more features will find their way here as the year draws to a close. Watch this space!
