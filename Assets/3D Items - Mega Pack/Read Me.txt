To make use of the items pivot points look to the right of the four main control buttons (pan, move, rotate, scale), and you'll see two other buttons.

The first toggles between "Center" or "Pivot", and the second toggles between "Local" or "Global".

Use "Pivot" for the first one and "Local" for the second one.
